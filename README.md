# 🔐 ChainSage – AI-Powered Smart Contract Vulnerability Analyzer

**ChainSage** is an advanced AI-based security analyzer that detects, explains, and visualizes vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based Solidity smart contracts. Powered by a fusion of deep learning (CodeBERT, Mistral), anomaly detection (Isolation Forest), and rule-based logic, ChainSage offers a seamless DevSecOps solution through its powerful FastAPI backend and modern Streamlit UI.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Detection Engine**
  - Uses **CodeBERT** (fine-tuned on Solidity contracts) and **Mistral** for advanced contextual analysis
  - Identifies logical vulnerabilities like `Reentrancy`, `tx.origin misuse`, and more

- 🔍 **Hybrid Rule-Based Enhancements**
  - Custom detection for `.call()`, `unchecked-send`, and unprotected ownership transfer
  - Works alongside the ML models to increase reliability and precision

- 📊 **Dynamic Risk Diagrams with Graphviz**
  - Converts control flow into **visual threat maps**
  - Clearly highlights critical paths and exploitable entry points

- 🧠 **Streamlit-Powered Dashboard**
  - Upload Solidity `.sol` contracts for instant analysis
  - Displays AI-generated HTML reports and SVG graphs

- 🔐 **Secure Coding Recommendations**
  - Suggestions inspired by **OpenZeppelin**, **ConsenSys**, and **Slither** audits
  - Actionable prevention tips integrated into every finding

- ⚙️ **FastAPI & CLI Integration**
  - RESTful API for remote ML inference and contract analysis
  - Run directly via command-line or hook into CI/CD pipelines

- 🧪 **Included Vulnerable Contracts**
  - Sample `.sol` contracts with known issues for testing and demoing
  - Great for education, debugging, and benchmarking

## 🧠 AI & Detection Models Used

| Model               | Role                                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **CodeBERT**     | Transformer model fine-tuned to classify Solidity snippets |
| 🔎 **Mistral-7B**   | Explains detected issues in natural language (via prompting) |
| 🌲 **Isolation Forest** | Detects outliers in contract structure/statistics      |
| ⚠️ **Rule Engine**  | Uses RegEx and patterns to detect risky Solidity behaviors |
